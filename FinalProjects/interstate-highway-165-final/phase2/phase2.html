        <h1>The Interstate Highway System: the Road to a Growing Nation</h1>
        <p class="center">Gabriel Hartman ghartman@ucsc.edu</p>
<!--
        <p> The Interstate Highway Act, passed in 1956, created a 41,000-mile highway system across the United States aiming to connect the states and provide a safe, effective, personal, and affordable means of transpotation for citizens.</p>
        <p> Construction of the highway continued over the decades since, with a 2000 mile addition being passed as recently as 1997.</p>
        <p> This construction was fragmented and parts of the highway were completed before others. As the highway grew, how did it affect the lives of Americans living in the places with highway growth? Were they more prosperous? Did their commute times change? Can we show a meaningful link between the construction of parts of the system and meaningful variables in areas it was built?</p>
-->
        
        <h2> Purpose </h2>
        
        <p> In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the Interstate Highway Act, fundind a 41,000-mile network of highways across the United States. This has been called one of the best investments a nation ever made. The amount of money spent on the interstate highway system was returned in safety, economic gains, and improved quality of life for Americans. I want to show that federally funded investments to public infrastructure such as the Interstate Highway System can be cost effective and yield useful returns for the nation.</p>
        
        <h2> Data Design </h2>
        
        <p> <strong>Data Variable 1:</strong> growth of the interstate highway system over time. I want to show how long and in which parts of the nation the Interstate Highway System was throughout its construction from 1956-1996 (perhaps some years before and after for context.) The data for this will have to come from multiple sources: one for the span of the highway itself (modern data will suffice) and another data source stating when different parts of the interstate highway were constructed. The first dataset was compiled by somebody and can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jalbertbowden/us-data/tree/master/shapefiles/us-interstates/geojson">github.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Interstate_Highways">The fine folks at Wikipedia</a> have compiled some of the second dataset, although I'd love to see if I can find a more detailed dataset showing the parts within each highway being constructed over a few years as the first visualization source below shows. </p>
            
        <p><strong>Data Variable 2:</strong> Vehicle Accident and Death data. <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2007/pdf/fi200.pdf">the Federal Highway Administration</a> has this data.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data Variable 3:</strong> Commute time and method data. The <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/commuting/data.html">U.S. Census</a> has this data</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data Variable 4:</strong> The amount spent and the sources of the revenue going towards the interstate highway system. Unfortunately it doesn't look like anybody has put the yearly information all in one place, but it's all available in the yearly budgets for the U.S. Government <a href="https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/content/?toc_id=220045&filepath=/files/docs/publications/usbudget/bus_1957.pdf&start_page=81">(example: 1957)</a></p>
        
        <p> <strong> Data Variable 5:</strong> Population Density by State over time - from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141121134738/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/tabs15-65.pdf">the U.S. Census</a></p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <h2> Visualization Design </h2>
        
        <p> The main visualization layout will be a geomap, with a timeline slider to show various dates (perhaps show by decade, due to the nature of the census data). Data variables can be shown on the map mapped to colors by category.</p> 
        
        <p> To show expenditures on the highway system, the timeline can show on it a line chart of highway expenditures by year (adjusted for inflation). (Like in <a href="https://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/031/">this visualization example.</a>)
        
        <p>There will be a panel to select what data variable to overlay on top of the highway growth change over time between the non-highway data variables: commute data, vehicle accident data, and population data.</p>
        
        <p> To show expenditures, each individual highway will be hoverable, bolding the highway selected. Hovering a particular highway will show a tooltip on the side indicating what highway it is, the cost of constructing that highway, the years during which it was under initial construction, and the areas it services. </p>

        <h2> Questions </h2>
        
        <p> Some questions that occured to me during the drafting of this document:</p>

        <p> What is the most effective way to visualize a budget? Showing how much income was generated by the excise taxes as a part of the Interstate Highway Act in contrast to how much was spent on it might be interesting - Eisenhower and Congress made the Interstate Highway Act "self-liquidating," meaning it would not add to the national debt.</p>
        
        <p>Thoughts on additional interesting information from the census data that might contribute to the purpose of the project?</p>
        
        <p> Would it be more effective to have a time slider by decade (to match census data) or interpolate census data within decades and have the time slider change by year to show in more detail the construction of the highway system?</p>

Notes from meetings with...
    
    Karthik:
Sankey diagram - shows flow of sources of income on left to expenditures on the right - shows how various sources of funding were used
COuld have it integrated with the time slider 
    traffic data for each interstate - metrocosm.com/gget-the-data/#interstatetraffic - perhaps line is thicker for more traffic, thinner for less traffic? 
    data by county - especially census data - looks better. 
    makes more sense, because you can see within a particular county can see that data if multiple interstates cross between counties
    interesting about public  transportation data - people using public transportation is going down over time, overall number of commuters 


    suresh which i apparently forgot to save....
    
    
    important bit: get high level granularity data on traffic accidents + commute time.
