This visulaization will show how the state of Latino Education has improved over the recent years and how this has affected Latino lifestyle in the US. The rates of Hispanics dropping out of high school has siginifcantly dropped, college enrollment is on the up, and student debt is lower for Hispanics. These are all factors indicating an improvment in Hispanic Education. My visulization will tell the story of why this is happening.

Most of my data will be coming from the Pew Research Center which has plenty of data for me to work with. I will concentrate on the years 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015. However, I may add years to visualize certain aspects of the culture that are changing.

I have searched for visualizations about hispanics but mostly found visualizations about foreign immigration and population of hispanics in the US(see links 1 and 2). These can be useful however because I could use the population or immigration data as a baseline. I want to make my visualization based more on the 3rd link. A radar graph with a time slider I believe would be great in showing the difference between the data throughout time.
